Currently learning to use R and R studio as a tool. But what do I want to achieve.

Goals:
1. Be Able to Visualize Data
2. Be able to Clean and Tidy Data
3. Know enough statistics to adequately analyze the data
4. Hypothesis Testing


Plans:
1. Work Through R for Data Science By Hadley - https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html
2. Practical Statistics for Data Science - https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Janine-Zitianellis/post/Can_anyone_please_suggest_a_books_on_machine_learning_using_R_Programming/attachment/613a5b83647f3906fc975a71/AS%3A1066204907204608%401631214467436/download/Practical+Statistics+for+Data+Scientists+50%2B+Essential+Concepts+Using+R+and+Python+by+Peter+Bruce%2C+Andrew+Bruce%2C+Peter+Gedeck.pdf

3. Find another Statitics Testing. Maybe something bio specific:

    https://www.biostathandbook.com/ and the associated R Handbook http://rcompanion.org/documents/RCompanionBioStatistics.pdf
